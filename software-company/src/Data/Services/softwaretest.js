    description:
      "Functional testing verifies that the software performs as expected, according to its defined specifications. This testing type normally includes build verification, components’ integration, and system testing, and takes the majority of the pre-release testing time.The QA team executes test cases to cover various scenarios and edge cases, ensuring that all features work efficiently. Here the testing procedures go deep into each module, ensuring the software functions as planned.",

    title: "Performance Testing",
    description:
      "In manual testing, a tester manually interacts with your application to ensure it’s reliable and ready to perform in real-world scenarios. This approach does not rely on test scripts or automated testing tools. Manual testers create detailed test cases, identify bugs, and track execution to make sure all aspects of your app are thoroughly tested. Complex interfaces with interactive features or animations are often ideal candidates for manual testing. By bringing human senses to the process, manual testing effectively catches potential issues that automated testing might miss.",
