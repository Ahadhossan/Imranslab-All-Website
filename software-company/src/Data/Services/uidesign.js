  {
    id: "ui-vs-ux",
    question: "What is the difference between UI and UX design?",
    answer:
      "UI (User Interface) design focuses on the visual elements of a product, like buttons, colors, icons, and typography. It ensures users can interact easily with the product. UX (User Experience) design goes deeper into how the product feels, ensuring the flow is intuitive and meets user needs. UX involves research, journey mapping, and testing, while UI brings those ideas to life visually.",
  },
  {
    id: "importance-ui-ux",
    question: "Why is UI/UX design important?",
    answer:
      "A strong UI/UX design creates a product that’s not just visually appealing but also functional and user-friendly. It helps reduce bounce rates, increases conversions, and improves user retention. By understanding user behaviors and needs, UI/UX design ensures your product solves problems effectively and creates a positive impression.",
  },
  {
    id: "involvement-design",
    question: "Will I be involved in the design process?",
    answer:
      "Yes, collaboration is key. We involve you in every step. Starting from the initial research to the final prototypes. We make sure the design fits with your brand, goals, and community by meeting, updating, and getting feedback regularly.",
  },
  {
    id: "redesign-existing",
    question: "Can you redesign an existing website or app?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We start by auditing your current design to identify usability issues. We also look for areas for improvement. Then, we create a strategy for updating the UI/UX. This could include modernizing the look, optimizing flows, or making the product more accessible.",
  },
  {
    id: "prototypes-provided",
    question: "Do you provide prototypes?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we deliver interactive prototypes using tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or InVision. Prototypes simulate the final product’s functionality and allow you to test user flows before development. This minimizes risks and ensures the design meets expectations.",
  },
  {
    id: "accessibility",
    question: "Is accessibility part of the design process?",
    answer:
      "Yes, accessibility is a top priority. We follow WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) to make designs inclusive. This includes ensuring proper color contrast, adding alt text for images, making navigation keyboard-friendly, and providing captions or transcripts for multimedia.",
  },
  {
    id: "testing-services",
    question: "Do you offer testing services for designs?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we perform usability testing to identify pain points in the prototype. This includes A/B testing, click tracking, and user interviews. We also use analytics tools to evaluate performance and make data-driven improvements. Testing ensures the design meets user needs and is error-free before development.",
  },
  {
    id: "measure-success",
    question: "How do you measure the success of a UI/UX design?",
    answer:
      "We track metrics like task success rate, time on task, and user error rates. Other indicators include bounce rates, conversion rates, and customer satisfaction scores. Qualitative feedback from users during testing also helps measure the design’s effectiveness and guides further improvements.",
